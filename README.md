# Good ReadMe Generator	

Created a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. 

## But why?
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.	


## User Story
AS A developer	
I WANT a README generator	
SO THAT I can easily put together a good README for a new project	

## Instructions	
The application runs with the following command:	
node index.js	
The user is prompted for their GitHub username and other information according to the project the README is for.	

## The README will be populated with the following:	
* At least one badge	
* Project title	
* Description	
* Table of Contents	
* Installation	
* Usage	
* License	
* Contributing	
* Tests	
* Questions	
* User GitHub profile picture	
* User GitHub email
